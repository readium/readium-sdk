/**
 The SpineItem class provides access to the spine of a publication.
 
 A publication's spine describes the top-level items contained in that publication
 in navigation order, such as the chapters of a book and its frontispiece,
 library/copyright page, dedication, index, and so on. This differs from a Table Of
 Contents in that the TOC might omit some of these items: it's not common for a TOC
 to reference the frontispiece of a book, or its cover.
 
 Additionally, the spine is used to determine where to go next when stepping from one
 content document to the next or the previous document. The appropriate spine item is
 used to determine what the next and previous items are, rather than relying on the
 TOC, which might choose not to reference certain items. The intention is that the
 spine be a one-dimensional array of all the visitable content in a publication in
 the order that it would be traversed.
 
 Most importantly, a content document **must** be referenced in the spine in order
 for it to be navigable. A TOC which references a document that's not in the spine
 is considered badly-formed.
 
 Spine items can be consedered either linear or non-linear. Non-linear items are
 those which are part of the publication's flow but which are not considered as
 candidates for next/previous steps. An example of this might be the front cover or
 the table of contents: these would typically be displayed elsewhere by a
 sufficiently advanced reading system, so simply flipping through the publication
 they would not be encountered; placing them in the spine, however, allows a CFI or
 hyperlink to still reference them directly.
 
 SpineItems in Readium are implemented as a doubly-linked list. Each SpineItem has a
 pointer to the items preceeding and succeeding it in the spine. These can be
 accessed directly using the Next() and Previous() methods. When stepping between
 spine items, however, the NextStep() and PriorStep() methods can be used to
 implicitly skip any non-linear items.
 
 @remarks As a linked-list structure, each SpineItem holds an *owning reference* to the
 following item, and a *non-owning reference* to the preceding item. When a
 SpineItem is destroyed, it will delete the next SpineItem in the chain, and will
 set its prior item's pointer-to-next to be `nullptr`.
